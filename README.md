## About the project
The PNW Additive Manufacturing Service enables PNW students, and faculty members to utilize the Additive Manufacturing Club 3D printers through a user-friendly website. When requesting a print, you may decide which filament to be used, it's color, and the infill density configured when sliced. Pricing has yet to be determined. Depends on the filament, and amount used.

> You may visit the pre-production version of this service at https://pnw3d.com being actively tested with different departments and senior-projects.

Please view the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for changes and updates to the service.
